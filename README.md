## Ideas / Free-association
* Katamari Dapony
  * See the new shirt from welovefine
  + Might be able to build with Desktop Ponies
  - Heavy on art requirements; medium on logic 

* Milk Chocolate Launcher
  * Discord drinks and throws "empty" glasses of chocolate milk; you 
    have to catch them before they destory the town.
  * Like a "catch the falling object" game mixed with Missle Defense.
  + Light on art requirements
  - Not necessarily good "game" material
