My Little Gamejam - README
===========================

Theme: Chaos

## Ideas / Free-association
* Katamari Dapony
  * See the new shirt from welovefine
  + Might be able to build with Desktop Ponies
  - Heavy on art requirements; medium on logic 

* Milk Chocolate Launcher
  * Discord drinks and throws "empty" glasses of chocolate milk; you 
    have to catch them before they destory the town.
  * Like a "catch the falling object" game mixed with Missle Defense.
  + Light on art requirements
  - Not necessarily good "game" material

* Cutie Pox... Stuff...
  * Everypony running in horror because of the Cutie Pox?
  * Its not discord, but it's definitely chaos.

* Tag/Keepaway
  * You play as Twilight; Discord running around doing his discord-y 
    thing to other Elements of Harmony.
  * Other ponies running away from you; could be level based (different 
    runway actions per pony) or all at once (simple tag)
  - Medium difficulty on artwork; lots of run cycles.
  - The all-at-once mode doesn't make much sense as a game really

* Chaos = Random = Chance...
  * Some kind of game of chance?
    * Discord and Trixie would both work well here.
  + Could be *VERY* light on the assets.
  * Needs to not be a vanilla rehash -- needs to be ponified.

* Chaos = Random = Unpredictable...
  * Your actions make some kind (obvious) long term unpredictable effect 
    on the outcome.
    * Dynamic stabilization problems
      * Overcoming the chaos, but the obvious "games" aren't seen as 
        chaotic (e.g. balance a tower of objects)
  * Derpy can be unpredictable... But it needs to be clear that her 
    actions are *chaotic*
