Milk Chocolate Defense
===========================

**A MyLittleGameJam Game**

## Premise
With the help of Twilight, the Elements of Harmony have returned to 
their normal selves. As they go off to confront Discord, you (playing as 
the former Rainbow Dash) must protect Ponyville from the chocolate milk 
grenades that Discord has begun to lob around. Miss a grenade, and a
building is destroyed!

Use your **Dragon's Breath** to evaporate the milk before it hits 
anything and destroys the town. It only has a limited range though -- 
you'll need to run around town to get them all.

## Technical Notes
This game is put together using the 'gamejs' library. Its my first 
attempt to make a game in javascript, so we'll see how this goes :D
