<h1>Chocolate Milk Attack</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ponyville is under attack! Discord, having been recently released and taken over Equestria, is sitting back for a bit to enjoy all the chaos he has created. His beverage of choice for the occasion? Glasses of chocolate milk, fresh from a chocolate rain cloud. Chaotic literrer that he is, Discord tosses remanants behind him as an explosive chocolate milk grenade.</p>
<p>With Twilight off to gather the others for a second assault with the Elements of Harmony, Princess Celestia herself has tasked you (as the former Rainbow Dash) with ensuring the safety of Ponyville. Though the <i>last</i> thing you want to do is breathe more fire after that little letter-recieving incident earlier, you understand that using its blowtorch-like flame to evaporate the milk before impact is Ponyville's only hope.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Use the arrow keys to move. Press Space to use your Dragon's Breath to destroy the incoming chocolate milk grenades before they hit the houses!</p>
